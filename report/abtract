Abstract
==============

The original idea of the project is to create a simple program which will be able to go through various text analysis methods. NLP(Natural language processing) usually deals with these points, so basically it is a NLP project. NLP includes various concepts like lemmetising, tokenization, semantic analysis, POS-tagging, summary-formation, grammar-check, word sense disambuguity removal, etc.
Among all these concepts, the proposed project will deal with tokenization, POS-tagging,lemmetising and some other features as described in later context. The main use of this project work will be for the reasearch teams which deal with text analysis. Standard libraries are used so it will be easy enough to debug and as PYTHON language supports platform independence, it will work same on various kinds of operating systems.
